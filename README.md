# Cloutware

**Data Driven, Culture Approved.**  

Cloutware is an AI-powered advertising intelligence platform that fuses **real-time cultural insights** from Qloo’s Taste API with the **blazing speed of Groq’s LLM** to generate hyper-relevant, culturally fluent ad campaign blueprints in just a few seconds.

Built for startups, creators, and brands, Cloutware turns cultural signals into strategic advantage delivering full campaign guides with slogans, platform tactics, influencer strategies, sound design, and more, all tailored to your audience.


## Overview

Cloutware was created by me during a hackathon to solve a critical gap in the advertising world: campaigns that feel out of touch.

Most tools rely on guesswork. Cloutware uses **real-time cultural data** (TV, music, film, books) and **ultra-fast AI reasoning** to generate **presentation-ready campaign strategies** instantly.

## Features

**Culturally Intelligent Campaigns**  
- Powered by Qloo’s Taste API to analyze what people are *actually* watching, listening to, and loving.

**Lightning-Fast AI**  
- Uses Groq’s LLM (llama3-70b-8192) to generate full campaign guides.

**Full Campaign Blueprint Includes:**
- Campaign names & slogans
- Visual Architecture
- Cultural tie-ins (festivals, shows, music)
- Platform-specific content strategy
- Viral content ideas
- Influencer strategy
- Budget breakdown
- Color palette & typography
- Sound design & posting schedule amongst others

**User-Friendly Interface**  
- Sleek, responsive frontend with smooth parallax effects and a 3D Spline background.
- Real-time typewriter animation for AI output.
- Template Library: Industry-specific campaign starters (fashion, tech, education).

**Full-Stack Architecture**  
- Frontend: Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript (hosted on Vercel)
- Backend: Node.js + Express (hosted on Render)
- APIs: Qloo (cultural insights), Groq (AI inference)
